        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <h3>Hi there! I'm Naomi Chellea Espiritu</h3>
        <p>If there's one thing people know about me, it's my infectious happiness and boundless cheerfulness. Born on December 12, 2005, in the vibrant Philippines, and now calling Dubai my home, I've always had a talent for finding joy in the little things.</p>
        <p>Currently, I am pursuing a degree in Creative Computing at the university, immersing myself in the world of technology and creativity. My heart beats for fitness and fashion, two passions that ignite my soul. As an extroverted individual with a magnetic personality, I thrive in social settings and embrace life with open arms.</p>
        <p>My family is the cornerstone of my existence, serving as my guiding light and source of unwavering motivation.</p>
